# Python Assignment 3

This repository contains solutions for Python Assignment 3, which includes two programming tasks demonstrating fundamental Python concepts including loops, recursion, and modular programming.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Factorial Calculation

**File:** `t1_factorial.py`

A program that calculates the factorial of a user-provided number using two different methods: iterative (loop) and recursive.

**Features:**

- Accepts integer input from the user
- Implements factorial using a for loop
- Implements factorial using recursive function
- Displays results from both methods

**How to run:**

```bash
python t1_factorial.py
```

### Task 2: Mathematical Calculations

**File:** `t2_calculations.py`

A program that demonstrates modular programming by using a custom math module to perform various mathematical calculations on user input.

**Features:**

- Imports functions from `mymath.py` module
- Calculates square root, natural logarithm, and sine of a number
- Displays formatted results for each calculation

**How to run:**

```bash
python t2_calculations.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
