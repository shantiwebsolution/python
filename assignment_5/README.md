# Python Assignment 5: Dictionaries and List Operations

This repository contains solutions for Python Assignment 5, which includes two programming tasks demonstrating fundamental dictionary operations and list slicing in Python.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Dictionary of Student Marks

**File:** `t1_create_dictionary_of_student_marks.py`

A program that creates a dictionary of student marks and allows querying marks by entering a student's name.

**Features:**

- Predefined dictionary with student names and their marks
- Takes user input for a student name
- Displays the marks if the student exists in the dictionary
- Shows "Student not found." if the student does not exist

**How to run:**

```bash
python3 t1_create_dictionary_of_student_marks.py
```

### Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

**File:** `t2_demonstrate_list_slicing.py`

A program that demonstrates list slicing operations by extracting and manipulating parts of a list.

**Features:**

- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10
- Extracts the first five numbers using list slicing
- Creates a reversed copy of the extracted list
- Prints the original list, extracted list, and reversed list

**How to run:**

```bash
python3 t2_demonstrate_list_slicing.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
