# Python Assignment 2

This repository contains solutions for Python Assignment 2, which includes two programming tasks demonstrating fundamental Python concepts.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
**File:** `t1_check_num.py`

A program that takes user input and determines whether the entered number is even or odd.

**Features:**
- Accepts integer input from the user
- Uses modulo operator to check divisibility by 2
- Displays the result in a formatted message

**How to run:**
```bash
python t1_check_num.py
```

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
**File:** `t2_add_loop.py`

A program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a loop.

**Features:**
- Uses a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50
- Accumulates the sum in a variable
- Displays the final result

**How to run:**
```bash
python t2_add_loop.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
